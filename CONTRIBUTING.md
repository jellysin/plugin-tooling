# Contributing

Develop on a feature branch from main and submit a pull request with a Conventional
Commit title. Squash merging keeps release notes attributable to reviewed changes.
Required checks use `strict: false`; merging does not require an up-to-date branch.

## Validate locally

Use Python 3.14.7, pinned in `.python-version`. Production code supports Python 3.13
and newer and needs no pip installation. Development dependencies are pinned and
hash checked:

```sh
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m ruff check .
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m coverage report
python tools.py check-policy
actionlint
```

Coverage must reach 85%, including branches. Tests use two plugin identities and
temporary directories; they do not publish releases. Record unavailable validation.

`pyproject.toml` declares supported runtimes (`>=3.13`); `.python-version` pins the
exact CI interpreter. Renovate's [PEP 621 manager](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/pep621/#dependency-types)
identifies the former as `requires-python`. Its scoped
[`widen` strategy](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/versioning/pep440/#rangesconstraints)
keeps that compatibility range rather than pinning it to a single Python patch.
Exact CI interpreter and dependency updates remain enabled and require PR review.
Raise the supported minimum deliberately when production code requires it.

## Release contract

Release-please collects conventional commits in release PRs and maintains proposed
versions and changelogs. The shared workflow sets `skip-github-release: true` and
dispatches only the caller's `ci.yml` for returned release PR branches. A main merge
can open or update a release PR; it cannot create a tag, draft or published release.
Merging the release PR updates version files and changelogs without publication.
The reusable workflow has no publication inputs or tag output.

Publication is a separate, explicitly authorized operation. Tags use stable
three-part SemVer. Consumers pin Actions or reusable workflows to a full commit SHA
and annotate released versions for Renovate. The shared PR workflow does not
create those tags or dispatch publication workflows.

When publication is authorized, the publisher requires `release.yml` to run **on
the exact tag ref** with an existing draft. Checking out a tag from a main-triggered
workflow does not change the OIDC source identity. Publication validates the exact
tag commit, attests every artifact, verifies existing bytes, uploads missing draft
assets, rechecks the complete draft, then publishes. Retry on the same tag. A
mismatch needs a new version; an incomplete published release is never repaired.
Only expected zero-byte `starter` assets in a freshly revalidated draft may be
deleted during failed-upload recovery. A changed or uploaded asset stops recovery.

If an original tag already has verified attestations but its publisher cannot
finish, a reviewed `recover-release.yml` may opt into `verified-tag-recovery`.
Dispatch that workflow from `main`; retain the actual GitHub context variables and
check out the exact original tag with full history and fetched `origin/main`.
Its source must be an ancestor of both the workflow's immutable commit and
`origin/main`. Rebuild reproducibly and verify the original artifact attestations;
do not re-attest recovery builds or change the tag. Grant only repository-scoped
contents writes for publication, with no attestation or OIDC write permissions.
The publisher independently enforces this context, all original provenance checks,
and numeric release identity. A vanished draft requires investigation, not a
replacement selected by tag.

Use only the calling repository's GITHUB_TOKEN. Plugin repository updates run in
`jellysin/repo`, which opens its own PR. No cross-repository write token, release
App, runtime package, or installed plugin dependency is required.

Workflow defaults are read-only. Writes belong to the narrow jobs that need them.
Bot CI explicitly dispatches the PR branch. No workflow assumes a token-created
event will recursively trigger another workflow.
GitHub may also create an approval-required PR run for each bot-authored update.
Review the current PR and approve that real run before merging; a successful
dispatch does not replace its approval. Do not fabricate checks or weaken protection.
